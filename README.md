# KmerRec
This is a Python3 implementation to predict recombination rates in plant species using the count of kmers per 100 kb as input features. It uses the linear regression model to develop the predictions. Data are provided for Arabidopsis, bean, maize, rice, sorghum and tomato. Each file contain data set for 2-mers and 3-mers following the extraction procedure of  [kmerExtractor](https://github.com/criccio35/kmerExtractor), along with recombination rates. Jupyter notebooks and output files with regression coeffients of the linear model are also provided.
